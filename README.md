####Easily Create Google Maps with custom markers / infoboxes


This is seriously work in progress, not ready for use yet, still designing according to various use cases that come up needing Google Maps.

I got a lot of projects that pretty much demanded the same degree of customization and behavior from Google Maps.

1. Custom styles for the map.
2. Custom Marker images as well as for hover and select
3. Dynamic content in Markers
4. Custom infoboxes for each marker.

Rather than build these custom maps over and over again this is an attempt at packaging that functionality into a couple of classes. All of the marker data and content is loaded into a json object and then fed to this to generate the custom map.
